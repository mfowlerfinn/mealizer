  Ancho chile paste, made from dried poblano peppers, lends its delicious
  smokiness to these beef tacos. Two cooling toppings balance it out: marinated
  radish slices and dollops of lime-seasoned sour cream. For a sweet, savory
  side with a hint of heat, we’re roasting sweet potato rounds, then sprinkling
  them with Monterey Jack and pickled jalapeño before returning them to the oven
  to melt the cheese.

<div class="ingredients">Ingredients</div>

<div class="ingredientsBox">
  10 oz Beef, diced<br />

  4 Flour Tortillas<br />

  3 Radishes<br />

  2 Scallions<br />

  1 Lime<br />

  1 Sweet Potato<br />

  2 oz Monterey Jack Cheese<br />

  2 teaspoons Ancho Chile Paste<br />

  1 oz Pickled Jalapeño Pepper, sliced<br />

  1/4 cup Sour Cream<br />
</div>

<div class="directions">Notes / Directions</div>

<div class="preparationBox">
  1. Preheat the oven to 450°F. Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil. Wash and
  dry the fresh produce. Cut the sweet potato into 1/2-inch-thick rounds. Place
  on the prepared sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and
  pepper; turn to coat. Arrange in an even layer. Roast 20 to 22 minutes, or
  until lightly browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Leaving the oven
  on, remove the roasted sweet potato from the oven.<br /><br />2. While the
  sweet potato roasts, quarter the lime. Cut off and discard the ends of the
  radishes; thinly slice into rounds. Place in a bowl with the juice of 2 lime
  wedges; season with salt and pepper. Set aside to marinate, stirring
  occasionally, for at least 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
  Cut off and discard the root ends of the scallions; thinly slice, separating
  the white bottoms and green tops. Grate the cheese on the large side of a box
  grater. Roughly chop the jalapeño pepper. Thoroughly wash your hands and
  cutting board immediately afterwards.<br /><br />3. While the sweet potato
  continues to roast, pat the beef dry with paper towels; season with salt and
  pepper. In a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive
  oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned beef in an even layer. Cook,
  without stirring, 2 to 3 minutes, or until browned. Add the white bottoms of
  the scallions, chile paste, and 2 tablespoons of water; season with salt and
  pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until thoroughly
  combined and the beef is cooked through. Turn off the heat and season with
  salt and pepper to taste.<br /><br />4. While the beef cooks, stack the
  tortillas on a large piece of aluminum foil; tightly wrap to seal. Carefully
  place directly onto the oven rack. Warm 7 to 9 minutes, or until heated
  through and pliable. Remove from the oven and transfer to a work surface;
  carefully unwrap.<br /><br />5. Top the roasted sweet potato with the cheese
  and as much of the jalapeño pepper as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d
  like the dish to be. Return to the oven and roast 2 to 4 minutes, or until the
  cheese is melted and lightly browned. Remove from the oven.<br /><br />6.
  While the sweet potato finishes roasting, in a bowl, combine the sour cream,
  the juice of the remaining lime wedges, and a drizzle of olive oil. Season
  with salt and pepper to taste. Divide the cooked beef among the warmed
  tortillas. Top with the marinated radishes (draining before adding) and lime
  sour cream. Garnish with the green tops of the scallions. Divide the tacos and
  finished sweet potato between 2 dishes. Enjoy!<br /><br />7. Preheat the oven
  to 450°F. Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil. Wash and dry the fresh produce.
  Cut the sweet potato into 1/2-inch-thick rounds. Place on the prepared sheet
  pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper; turn to coat.
  Arrange in an even layer. Roast 20 to 22 minutes, or until lightly browned and
  tender when pierced with a fork. Leaving the oven on, remove the roasted sweet
  potato from the oven.<br /><br />8. While the sweet potato roasts, quarter the
  lime. Cut off and discard the ends of the radishes; thinly slice into rounds.
  Place in a bowl with the juice of 2 lime wedges; season with salt and pepper.
  Set aside to marinate, stirring occasionally, for at least 10 minutes. Season

  paste, and 2 tablespoons of water; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring

  cooked through. Turn off the heat and season with salt and pepper to taste.<br /><br />10.

  Divide the tacos and finished sweet potato between 2 dishes. Enjoy!
